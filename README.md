Chartpress automate basic Helm chart development work. It is tightly used in development of the [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s) and [BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub) Helm charts.

## Features

Chartpress can do the following with the help of some configuration.

- Update Chart.yaml's version appropriately
- Build docker images and tag them appropriately
- Push built images to a docker image repository
- Update values.yaml to reference the built images
- Publish a chart to a Helm chart registry based on GitHub pages
- Reset changes to Chart.yaml and values.yaml

## How chart version and image tags are determined

Chartpress will infer chart versions and image tags using a few key pieces of
information.

1. `tag`: If not directly set by `--tag`, it will be inferred from most recent
   commit that is tagged in the _current branch_
   (as determined by `git describe`)
   or be set to 0.0.1 if no commit is tagged.
   1. If the `tag` has a leading `v` but is otherwise a valid
      [SemVer2](https://semver.org) version, the `v` will be stripped from Chart.yaml
      before its set as Helm 3 requires Helm chart versions to be SemVer2
      compliant.
1. The latest commit modifying content in a _relevant path_ since `tag`.
   1. `n`: The number of commits since the latest tagged commit on the branch, as an integer.
   1. `hash`: The latest commit's abbreviated hash, which is often 7-8 characters,
      prefixed with `h`.
1. If `tag` (like `0.10.0` or `0.10.0-beta.1`) contains a `-`, a `tag.git.n.hash`
   format will be used, and otherwise a `tag-0.dev.git.n.hash` format will be used.
1. If `--long` is specified or not. If `--long` is specified, tagged commits
   will always be written out with the `.git.n.hash` part appended to it, looking something
   like `1.0.0-0.dev.git.0.habcd123`

When producing a development version (with `.git.n.hash` on the end),
The _base_ version can come from one of two places,
depending on your configuration.
See [Controlling development version](#controlling-development-versions-in-chart.yaml) for more info.

### Examples chart versions and image tags

This is a list of realistic chart versions and/or image tags in a chronological
order that could come from using chartpress.

```
0.8.0

## Requirements

The following binaries must be in your `PATH`:

- [git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm)

If you are publishing a chart to GitHub Pages create a `gh-pages` branch in the
destination repository.

## Installation

```
pip install chartpress
```

## Usage

In a directory containing a `chartpress.yaml`, run:

    chartpress

to build your chart(s) and image(s). Add `--push` to publish images to docker
hub and `--publish-chart` to publish the chart and index to gh-pages.

```

## Configuration

A `chartpress.yaml` file contains a specification of charts and images to build
for each chart. Below is an example `chartpress.yaml` file.

```yaml
charts:
  # list of charts by name
  # each name should be a directory containing a helm chart
  - name: binderhub
    # the prefix to use for built images
    imagePrefix: jupyterhub/k8s-
    # tag to use when resetting the chart values
    # with the --reset flag. It defaults to "set-by-chartpress".
    resetTag: latest
    # version to use when resetting the Chart.yaml's version field with the
    # --reset flag. It defaults to "0.0.1-set.by.chartpress". This is a valid
    # SemVer 2 version, which is required for a helm lint command to succeed.
    resetVersion: 1.2.3-dev
    # Base path, relative to `chartpress.yaml`, where named charts are kept.
    # Default is same directory as `chartpress.yaml`
    basePath: ./helmcharts

    # baseVersion sets the base version for development tags,
    # instead of using the latest tag from `git describe`.
    # This gives you more control over development version tags
    # and lets you ensure prerelease tags are always sorted in the right order.
    # Only useful when publishing development releases.
    # Recommended together with a version-bumping tool like `tbump`.
    # if baseVersion is not a prerelease version (no -suffix),
    # the suffix `-0.dev` will be appended.
    baseVersion: 3.2.1-0.dev

    # The git repo whose gh-pages contains the charts. This can be a local
    # path such as "." as well but if matching <organization>/<repo> will be
    # assumed to be a separate GitHub repository.
    repo:
      git: jupyterhub/helm-chart
      published: https://jupyterhub.github.io/helm-chart

    # Publishing Helm charts to OCI registries (with a custom path prefix) is also supported,
    # via defining an `oci` key under `repo`.
    # For example, the following will push a chart named `binderhub` to Github's OCI registry under the path
    # `ghcr.io/jupyterhub/helm-charts/binderhub`
    # repo:
    #   oci: ghcr.io/jupyterhub
    #   prefix: helm-charts

    # Additional paths that when modified should lead to an updated Chart.yaml
    # version, other than the chart directory in <chart name> or any path that
    # influence the images of the chart. These paths should be set relative to
    # chartpress.yaml's directory.
    paths:
      - ../setup.py
      - ../binderhub
    # images to build for this chart (optional)
    images:
      binderhub:
        # imageName overrides the default name of the image. The default name
        # is the imagePrefix augmented with the key of this configuration. It
        # would be jupyterhub/k8s-binderhub in this case.
        imageName: jupyterhub/k8s-custom-image-name
        # Build arguments to be passed using docker's --build-arg flag as
        # --build-arg <key>=<value>. TAG and LAST_COMMIT are expandable.
        buildArgs:
          MY_STATIC_BUILD_ARG: "hello world"
          MY_DYNAMIC_BUILD_ARG: "{TAG}-{LAST_COMMIT}"
        # Build options to be passed to the docker build command. Pass a list
        # of strings to be appended to the end of the build command. These are
        # passed directly to the command line, so prepend each option with "--"
        # like in the examples below. TAG and LAST_COMMIT are expandable.
        extraBuildCommandOptions:
          - --label=maintainer=octocat
          - --label=ref={TAG}-{LAST_COMMIT}
          - --rm
        # contextPath is the path to the directory that is to be considered the
        # current working directory during the build process of the Dockerfile.
        # This is by default the folder of the Dockerfile. This path should be
        # set relative to chartpress.yaml.
        contextPath: ..
        # By default, changes to the contextPath will make chartpress rebuild
        # the image, but this option make that configurable.
        rebuildOnContextPathChanges: false
        # Path to the Dockerfile, relative to chartpress.yaml. Defaults to
        # "images/<image name>/Dockerfile".
        dockerfilePath: images/binderhub/Dockerfile
        # Path(s) in <chart name>/values.yaml to be updated with image name and
        # tag.
        valuesPath:
          - singleuser.image
          - singleuser.profileList.0.kubespawner_override.image
        # Additional paths, relative to chartpress.yaml's directory, that should
        # be used to indicate that a new tag of the image is required, aside
        # from the contextPath and dockerfilePath for building the image itself.
        paths:
          - assets
        # If chartpress is used to build images for multiple architectures but
        # not all of those architectures are supported by an image they can be
        # skipped
        skipPlatforms:
          - linux/arm64
```

### Controlling development versions

Like some "package version in version control" tools,
you don't need to manage versions at all in chartpress except by tagging commits.

However, relying only on tags results in "development versions" (versions published from commits after a release)
having somewhat confusing prerelease versions.

After publishing e.g. `1.2.3`, the next version will be `1.2.3-0.dev.git.10.habc`.
According to Semantic Versioning,
this is a "pre release" (good, it should be excluded from default installation),
but it means it comes _before_ 1.2.3 (wrong! it's 1 commit _newer_ than 1.2.3).
This is because prereleases should be defined relative to the _next_ release,
not the _last_ release. But git tags only store the _last_ release!

Chartpress 2.0 adds an option `chart.baseVersion`,
which allows setting the base version of development tags explicitly,
instead of using the version of the last tag found via `git describe`.

The main benefits of this are:

1. ensuring that published prerelease versions show up in the right order, and
2. giving you control over the version of a prerelease chart (is it 2.0.0-0.dev or 1.3.1-0.dev?)

Instead of publishing the sequence:

- 1.2.3
- 1.2.3-0.dev.git.10.habc (later than 1.2.3, but sorts _before_ 1.2.3!)

You can publish

- 1.2.3
- 1.3.0-0.dev.git.10.habc (prerelease based on the _next_ version, not _last_)

where chartpress will use the version in your `baseVersion` config as the base version,
instead of the last tag on the branch.

This takes some extra configuration, and steps in your release process:

1. You must set `baseVersion: 1.2.3-0.dev` in your chartpress.yaml to your _next_ prerelease:

   ```yaml
   charts:
     - name: mychart
       baseVersion: 1.2.3-0.dev
   ```

2. You must update baseVersion, especially after making a release.
   We recommend using a version bumping tool like [tbump][] to keep your baseVersion config and git tags in sync.

[tbump]: https://github.com/your-tools/tbump

A release process would generally look like this:

```bash
V=1.2.3
# tbump updates version, commits changes, tags commit, pushes branch and tag
tbump "$V"

# back to development
NEXT_V=1.2.4-0.dev
# bump version config, but no tag for starting development
tbump --no-tag "${NEXT_V}"
```

Any prerelease fields (such as `-0.dev` above, or `-alpha.1`)
will be left as-is, with the `.git.n.hash` suffix added.
If there is no prerelease (e.g. on the exact commit of a tagged release),
`-0.dev` will be added to the base version.
You **must** update baseVersion after making a release,
or `chartpress --reset` will fail due to incorrect ordering of versions.

A sample tbump config file can be found in [our tests](./tests/test_helm_chart/tbump.toml).

## Caveats

### Shallow clones

Chartpress detects the latest commit that changed a directory or file when
determining the version and tag to use for charts and images. This means that
shallow clones should not be used because if the last commit that changed a
relevant file is outside the shallow commit range, the wrong chart version and
image tag will be assigned.

#### Avoiding shallow clones with GitHub Actions

GitHub Workflow's commonly used GitHub Action called actions/checkout have a
clone clone-depth of 1 by default, configure it to make a full clone instead.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    with:
      # chartpress need the git branch's tags and commits
      fetch-depth: 0
```

### Command caching

Chartpress caches the results of some commands to improve performance.
This means chartpress should not be used as an importable library.

## Development

Testing of this python package can be done using
[`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest). For more details on the
testing, see [tests/README.md](tests/README.md).

```bash
# install chartpress locally
pip install  -e .

# install dev dependencies
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

# format and lint code
pre-commit run -a

# run tests
pytest --verbose --exitfirst
# some tests push to a local registry, you can skip these
pytest --verbose --exitfirst -m 'not registry'
```
